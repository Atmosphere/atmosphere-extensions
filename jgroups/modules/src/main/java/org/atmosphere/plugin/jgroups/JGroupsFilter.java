/**
 * This is attached to a Broadcaster you want to have in a clustered situation.
 * <p/>
 * Each clustered broadcaster should have its own instance of a JGroupsFilter and
 * likewise, each JGroupsFilter should have a circular reference back to that broadcaster.
 * <p/>
 * Therefore, when the JGroupsFilter is added to the Broadcaster config,
 * remember to make the reference circular by calling JGroupsFilter.setBroadcaster(bc)
 * or simply using the constructor with the Broadcaster to begin with.
 * <p/>
 * Uri is not currently used because the 'cluster name' is driven from the
 * JGroupsChannel itself.  I suppose it could be used to 'look up' the JGroupsChannel
 * if there is a registry of them implemented somehow, but its easier to just
 * inject the JGroupsChannel into the filter.
